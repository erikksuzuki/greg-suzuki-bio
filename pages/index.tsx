          Masayuki Gregory Suzuki was born in 1959 in Tokyo. In 1979, at the age
          of 19, he moved to Los Angeles, California, and attended The Los
          Angeles Mission College. During these years, he met up with his old
          friend, Osamu Kitajima, regarded by many as the original pioneer of
          blending eastern and western music, who soon became his mentor. After
          graduating as a music major, Greg became one of the first Japanese
          musicians to register in the Los Angeles Music Union. Based in Los
          Angeles, he began his musical career.
        </p>
        <p className="block mb-4">
          Together with Osamu, Greg recorded hundreds of TV commercials, and
          performed at numerous concerts and shows including the 1981 Montreal
          Jazz Festival, the Santa Barbara Jazz Festival in 1983, the 1984
          Olympic Games Opening, and countless other gigs. In a Japan Tour in
          1982, He and Osamu performed in Budokan at the Technics Jazz Festival
          at the Osaka Festival Hall.
        </p>
        <p className="block mb-4">
          In 1986, Greg switched gears and put his musical career on hold for
          the broader and more eminent career of show business; he joined Feld
          Entertainment Inc., the worldâ€™s largest live entertainment company.
          Since then, he has worked for the interests of prominent names in show
          business like Ringling Bros.- Barnum & Bailey Circus, The Greatest
          Show on Earth, Disney on Ice, and Disney Live.
        </p>
        <p className="block mb-4">
          His years of experience as Managing Director of Tours for Asia gave
          him the opportunity to explore his passions from a management
          perspective and he is responsible for establishing the company's
          annual presence of Disney on Ice and Disney Live in the Asia Pacific
          region.

              book tells the success story of father and son, who together were

        <p className="block mb-2">Synopsis:</p>
        <p className="block mb-4">
          "Fumio Suzuki, born to a merchant trader in Yokohama, was educated to
          speak and write English due to his locality of the Yokohama port. He
          used this ability, which few Japanese at the time had, to sell the
          licensing rights of the TV series and franchise, "Astro Boy," to
          America. Working with Hitchcock, it was the beginning of a fabulous
          career.
        </p>
        <p className="block mb-4">
          His son, Greg Suzuki, looked to fill these shoes after quitting a
          career in music. Thus, he began on a path that would take him further
          into the world of show business. The book details the events that take
          place between that time and today, in the form of letters exchanged
          between the two. In this poignant and inspiring book, hints of love
          and support between father and son are subtlety woven into the
          narrative.
        </p>
        <p className="block mb-4">
          Fumio's decisiveness and experience-based confidence and Greg's
          abounding effort to learn from him teach us that passion is important
          and the key to reaching success."{' '}
