            Hidemi Okawa, a writer on Japan's Asahi Weekly magazine, calls the
            book "touching." The following is an excerpt of his review: "This
            book tells the success story of father and son, who together were
            able to bridge the business of circus, ice show, and other live
            entertainment between the U.S. and Japan."

      <p className="block mb-2">Synopsis:</p>
      <p className="block mb-4">
        "Fumio Suzuki, born to a merchant trader in Yokohama, was educated to
        speak and write English due to his locality of the Yokohama port. He
        used this ability, which few Japanese at the time had, to sell the
        licensing rights of the TV series and franchise, "Astro Boy," to
        America. Working with Hitchcock, it was the beginning of a fabulous
        career.
      </p>
      <p className="block mb-4">
        His son, Greg Suzuki, looked to fill these shoes after quitting a career
        in music. Thus, he began on a path that would take him further into the
        world of show business. The book details the events that take place
        between that time and today, in the form of letters exchanged between
        the two. In this poignant and inspiring book, hints of love and support
        between father and son are subtlety woven into the narrative.
      </p>
      <p className="block mb-4">
        Fumio's decisiveness and experience-based confidence and Greg's
        abounding effort to learn from him teach us that passion is important
        and the key to reaching success."{' '}
